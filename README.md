# Integration 

The purpose of this project is act as an interface between different systems.

- 2 GLPI systems ( incident management )
- 1 webhook to create an incident
- 1 webhook to retrieve an incident
- 1 webhook to update an incident

The "adapter" component should handle incident state, mirroring it between GLPI systems.
